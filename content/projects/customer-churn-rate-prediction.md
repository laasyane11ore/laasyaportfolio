## Description
- Built predictive models to analyze customer churn rate patterns in a subscription-based service.
- Applied Machine Learning techniques such as tree based models (GBM, AdaBoost), neural networks and support vector machines to predict customer churn rate accurately with an F1 score of 0.7.
 

<!-- As the network generates the caption, word by word, the modelâ€™s gaze (attention) shifts across the image. This allows it to focus on those parts of the image which is more relevant for the next word to be generated.

<!-- Furthermore, beam search is used during inference to enhance the prediction result. The network was trained in **PyTorch** on an **Nvidia GTX 1060** graphics card for over 80 epochs. -->
